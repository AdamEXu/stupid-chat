# Generate T3 Chat Clone

Click the button on the website with a design Theo will surely love and it'll give you a T3 Chat clone. Not a good one, but a clone nonetheless. [t3.chat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ) is a ai chat website, which I assume means that it's an ai generated website where ai can chat with you...

## Running it locally

Idk why you'd ever want to run this stupid code locally but it's pretty simple

I use a Mac so instructions are for Mac. If you don't use a Mac go ask chatgpt to explain how to make it work ig.

First clone the repo

```
git clone https://github.com/AdamEXu/stupid-chat.git
cd stupid-chat
```

Then, you will create a Python virtual enviroment (please do this, if you don't you are a psycopath)

```
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
```

Now install dependencies

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

And run

```
python app.py
```

Congrats, you now have a T3 Chat clone generator.
